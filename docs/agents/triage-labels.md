# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of seven canonical triage roles: two that say what
kind of request an issue is, and five that say where it has got to. This file
maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

A triaged issue carries exactly one category label and one state label.

## Category roles

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `bug`                      | `bug`                | Something is broken           |
| `enhancement`              | `enhancement`        | New feature or improvement    |

## State roles

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the
corresponding label string from these tables.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
